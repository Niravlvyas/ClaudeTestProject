- **Urgency Classification**: Color-coded alerts for due dates
- **Store-Specific Views**: Filter predictions by pharmacy location
- **Contact Integration**: Direct email links to patient contacts
- **Data Visualization**: Summary cards and detailed tables
- **Export Functionality**: CSV export for offline analysis

## Technical Architecture

### Database Layer
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   SQL Server Database   │
├─────────────────────────┤
│ • cdc_patient_data      │
│ • cdc_dispense_data     │
│ • datax_configuration   │ ← New table we created
│ • pharmacy_master       │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Application Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Authentication**: Session-based auth
- **Data Processing**: Complex SQL with CTEs and window functions

---

## Development Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
**Human Input**: Clear, specific requirements
- "Create a table storing patientid, storeid, and contactemail"
- "Insert dummy records for each patient"
- "Predict refills based on DispensedDate + 30 days"
- "Only show patients with remaining repeats"

**Claude's Response**: Systematic exploration
- Analyzed existing database structure
- Identified column naming conventions
- Discovered data type constraints

### Phase 2: Database Design & Implementation

#### Challenge 1: Column Name Mismatch
**Issue**: Expected `PatientID` but found `dispenseid`
**Solution**: Adapted schema to match existing structure

#### Challenge 2: Data Type Overflow
**Issue**: `dispenseid` values exceeded INT capacity
**Solution**: Changed to VARCHAR(255) to accommodate large IDs

#### Implementation Success
```sql
-- Created table with 330,044 records
CREATE TABLE datax_configuration (
    id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    patientid VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    storeid BIGINT NOT NULL,
    contactemail VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
)
```

### Phase 3: Business Logic Development

#### Refill Prediction Algorithm
```sql
WITH LastDispenses AS (
    -- Get most recent dispense per patient/drug
    SELECT 
        PatPharmSysID,
        Drugname,
        DispensedDate,
        DATEADD(day, 30, DispensedDate) as PredictedRefillDate,
        TotalRepeats,
        RepeatNo
    FROM cdc_dispense_data
    WHERE TotalRepeats > 1 
      AND RepeatNo < TotalRepeats
)
```

#### Urgency Classification
- **Due Today**: Red alert - immediate action
- **Due Tomorrow**: Orange - prepare for tomorrow
- **Due This Week**: Yellow - upcoming refills
- **Due Next Week**: Green - advance planning
- **Due Later**: Gray - future consideration

### Phase 4: User Interface Creation

#### Design Principles
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly design
- **Intuitive**: Clear navigation and filters
- **Informative**: Summary cards for quick insights
- **Actionable**: Direct email links for patient contact

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. Database Discovery
**Challenge**: Unknown database schema and column names
**Solution**: Created exploration scripts to discover structure
```javascript
// check-patient-columns.js
// check-dispense-columns.js
// check-pharmacy-columns.js
```

### 2. Data Volume
**Challenge**: 330,044+ patient records to process
**Solution**: 
- Implemented efficient SQL queries with proper indexing
- Added store-based filtering to reduce data load
- Used CTEs for optimized data processing

### 3. Complex Business Logic
**Challenge**: Multiple conditions for refill eligibility
**Solution**: Layered approach with clear filters
- Filter 1: Has repeat prescriptions (TotalRepeats > 1)
- Filter 2: Has remaining repeats (RepeatNo < TotalRepeats)
- Filter 3: Within 30-day prediction window
- Filter 4: Valid patient and drug data

### 4. Real-time Performance
**Challenge**: Quick response times for large datasets
**Solution**:
- Store-specific queries (mandatory store selection)
- Indexed key columns (patientid, storeid)
- Optimized JOIN operations
- Limited result sets to 30-day window

## What Worked Well

### 1. Clear Communication
**Human Strengths**:
- Provided specific, actionable requirements
- Gave clear context about business logic
- Responded promptly to clarification needs

**Claude's Strengths**:
- Systematic problem-solving approach
- Adaptability to discovered constraints
- Comprehensive error handling

### 2. Iterative Development
- Started with database exploration
- Built incrementally (table → data → API → UI)
- Tested and fixed issues in real-time
- Committed changes systematically

### 3. Full-Stack Implementation
Successfully delivered:
- Database schema and data population
- Backend API with complex SQL logic
- Frontend with modern, responsive design
- Integration with existing authentication system

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Initial Planning
**Could Have Done Better**:
- Request database schema documentation upfront
- Define data types and constraints clearly
- Create a data dictionary before implementation

### 2. Error Handling
**Potential Enhancements**:
- Add more granular error messages
- Implement retry logic for database connections
- Add validation for edge cases

### 3. Testing Strategy
**Missing Components**:
- No unit tests created
- No integration tests
- No load testing for performance validation

### 4. Documentation
**Could Add**:
- API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Database schema diagrams
- User manual for pharmacy staff
- Deployment guide

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term Improvements

2. **SMS Notifications**: Add SMS alongside email contacts
3. **Batch Actions**: Select multiple patients for bulk notifications
4. **Adherence Tracking**: Link predictions to actual refill behavior
